# quickdraw_subset_CNN

## CNN & misc. ML models to classify subset of Google's Quickdraw dataset

Final project for ELEC 478 at Rice University. Wanted to see how well manually-built CNN using Tensorflow.Keras would perform on this dataset. SVM and regular ANN are there for course credit, please ignore lol
